# IMAGE-SEGMENTATION-WITH-U-NET

## Project Overview
This project implements an image segmentation system using the U-Net architecture. U-Net, a convolutional neural network designed for realtime autonomous driving, excels in distinguishing detailed structures within images. By training on pairs of images and their corresponding segmentation masks, the model learns to predict accurate masks for new images.

Image segmentation is crucial in fields such as:
- **Autonomous Driving**: Understanding road elements for safe navigation.
- **Medical Imaging**: Precise identification of tissues and organs.
- **Satellite Image Analysis**: Distinguishing land, water, and urban areas.

In this project, we demonstrate the effectiveness of U-Net on a custom dataset, achieving accurate segmentation results.
